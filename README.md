# Usage

Users first have an option of uploading pictures of the affected area to the website. Our machine learning algorithm will then classify and identify the disease or condition that is present, if any. Instead of outputting just one condition from an input, dermalab outputs several ranked diseases that doctors can further interpret based upon a patients individuality

However, we don't stop there! Users also receive a summary of their conditions - without all of the hard-to-understand medical jargon. That way, both patients and doctors are on the same page when it comes to understanding a disease diagnosis.
